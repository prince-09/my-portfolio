Prince is an intelligent, hard-worker and responsible person. My experience while working with Prince had been great. The best thing is that he is always ready to try new and challenging things. He has the credit for developing our startup app in a very short time. Though he is very good at doing tech related things, he doesn't limit himself to that only. He also provided inputs related to products during our meeting, which were very helpful. Any company/team would be lucky to have him.
